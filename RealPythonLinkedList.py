# lists are ordered
# memory array stores a collection of similar data types' sequential locations in the computer's memory, instead of randomly accessed
        # QUE?

# Big O Notation
# describes the performance of an algorithm in the worst case scenario
#   ex: how fast common operations are on different data structures, like linked lists and arrays
# O(1) or Constant Time: (Fastest time complexity)
# the algorithm will take the same amount of time regardless of the number of elements in the collection 
# O(N) Linear Time: (Slow time complexity)
# the algorithm performs slower the more elements there are in a collection
#  
## Performance of lists and linked list

#  a list is an array (sequential location in hardware), it comes with extra allocated space to accept new inputs
# appending a list at the end of the list makes the algorithm operate at the O(1) time complexity 
# adding item anywhere in the middle of the list makes the algorithm operate at O(N) time complexity
    # remember that in list the indexes need to be updated for every item after the added item
    # making lists slow and not great for algorithms that require 

# the time it takes to traverse the linked list grows with the number of elements
# accesing elements is an O event operation 
# linked lists never involve array resizing penalty
